      <div align="center"><u><b>Why another text editor?</b></u><br>
        <small><br>
          Simple, I didn't like any of the others they were all too flat
          ( sorry wrong sketch! ), anyway having used gedit for years it
          was getting increasingly difficult to keep it compiling
          without loads of gnome dependencies, looking around linux text
          editors seem to be VERY simple (leafpad) stupidly complex
          (GVim,Bluefish), trying to be all things to all people.<br>
          One of the best text editors I have used is BBEdit but that is
          only available on the mac, so I bit the bullet and decided to
          write my own with the best bits from BBEdit ( the name KKEdit
          is a tip of the hat to BBEdit ), gedit and leafpad. A simple
          uncluttered interface, no major dependencies, with just the
          features I use all the time, and TA DAH! KKEdit.<br>
          <br>
          <big><b><u>What it's not!</u></b></big><br>
          <br>
          KKEdit is NOT a word processor or a web page editor, it is NOT
          and IDE! It won't right code for you, it wont insist on
          inserting brackets ( REALLY annoying! ), it wont force you to
          use any particular style, it doesn't need you to break all
          your fingers trying to hit weird and wonderful key combo's and
          it is not tied to one particular distro, oh yes and it won't
          cost you a penny!<br>
          <br>
          <u><b><big>What it is and does</big></b></u><br>
          <br>
          KKEdit is a deceptivly simple text editor with syntax
          colouring.<br>
          It also has a function menu which allows you to jump instantly
          to a function definition, a navigation menu which will look in
          all open files for a function definition and then switch to
          that tab and go to the relevant line if it can't find a
          definition in any open files it will do a recursive search
          from the folder of the currently selected document, you can
          also highlight a #include directive and it will search for and
          try to open the file, include files surrounded by &lt;&gt;
          will be looked for in /usr/include, files surrounded by ""
          will be looked for in the current folder.<br>
          External tools can be added either globally or locally and
          when run can either replace the currently select text with
          their ouptut, replace all the files text, be run in a terminal
          or you can choose to ignore the output form the script, BASH,
          python and perl can be used for the script language or any
          interpretor that uses '#' as a comment marker.<br>
          A number of simple demo scripts are included in the folder
          "demotoools" ( good name eh ).<br>
          You can drag and drop a file onto the main toolbar/menu to
          open a file.</small><small><br>
          Session can be saved and reloaded.<br>
          Any amount of bookmarks can be added anywhere, selecting a
          bookmark from the menu will switch to that tab and move to the
          appropriate line.<br>
          Just type a line number into the edit box on the toolbar to
          jump straight to that line.<br>

        </b><u><b><a name="navanc"></a>Navigation Menu</b></u></big><br>
      <br>
      <small>The Navigation menu has four sub-menus - </small>Go To
      Definition,<small> </small>Open Include File, Go To Line <small>and</small>
      Search For Define.<br>
      <br>
      <small>To go where a function etc is defined, select it and choose
        'Go To Definition' KKEdit will then look in open files for the
        definition and switch to that page and highlight the appropriate
        line like so:<br>
        <br>
        <img alt="gotodefine" src="gotodefine.png" height="239"
          width="417"><br>
        <br>
      </small><img alt="define" src="define.png" height="476"
        width="507"><br>
      <small>As you can see as the definition was not in an open file
        KKEdit looks for the definition recursively starting from the
        folder where the file was opened from and if found opening the
        file and selecting the line with the definition.<br>
        The search depth for finding a definition is set in the prefs
        and defaults to 1 ie only looks for definitions in files in the
        same folder as any open documents, be careful about setting this
        too high as it can cause an unwanted delay when right clicking
        if it has to look in a lot of sub-folders.<br>
        <br>
        You can also open an include file just highlight the line and
        select&nbsp; </small>Open Include File<small> like so:<br>
        <img alt="openinclude" src="openinclude.png" height="290"
          width="440"><br>
        Include files are looked for in either /usr/include or the
        directory the current document is in, depending whether the file
        name is surrounded by '&lt;&gt;' or ' "" '.<br>
        <br>
      </small>Search for Define <small>will open an entry box and allow
        you to type in a definition or part of a definition and will try
        to find it in the usual places opening a file if necessary, the
        search is case insensitive.<br>

        <br>
        <img alt="funcmenu" src="functions.png" height="586" width="806"><br>
