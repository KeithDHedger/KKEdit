      <div align="center"><b><font size="+1">Why another text editor?</font></b><br>
        <br>
        <font size="-1">Simple, I didn't like any of the others they
          were all too flat ( sorry wrong sketch! ), anyway having used
          gedit for years it was getting increasingly difficult to keep
          it compiling without loads of gnome dependencies, looking
          around Linux text editors seem to be VERY simple (leafpad)
          stupidly complex (GVim,Bluefish), trying to be all things to
          all people. <br>
          One of the best text editors I have used is BBEdit but that is
          only available on the mac, so I bit the bullet and decided to
          write my own with the best bits from BBEdit ( the name KKEdit
          is a tip of the hat to BBEdit ), gedit and leafpad. A simple
          uncluttered interface, no major dependencies, with just the
          features I use all the time, and TA DAH! KKEdit.</font><br>
        <br>
        <b><font size="+1">What it's not! </font></b><br>
        <br>
        <font size="-1">KKEdit is NOT a word processor or a web page
          editor, it is NOT and IDE! It won't right code for you, it
          wont insist on inserting brackets ( REALLY annoying! ), it
          wont force you to use any particular style, it doesn't need
          you to break all your fingers trying to hit weird and
          wonderful key combo's and it is not tied to one particular
          distro, oh yes and it won't cost you a penny! </font><br>
        <br>
        <b><font size="+1">What it is and does <br>
          </font></b> <br>
        <font size="-1">KKEdit is a deceptively simple text editor with
          syntax colouring. <br>
          It also has a function menu which allows you to jump instantly
          to a function definition, a navigation menu which will look in
          all open files for a function definition and then switch to
          that tab and go to the relevant line if it can't find a
          definition in any open files it will do a recursive search
          from the folder of the currently selected document, you can
          also highlight a #include directive and it will search for and
          try to open the file, include files surrounded by &lt;&gt;
          will be looked for in /usr/include, files surrounded by ""
          will be looked for in the current folder.<br>
          External tools can be added either globally or locally and
          when run can either replace the currently select text with
          their output, replace all the files text, be run in a terminal
          or you can choose to ignore the output form the script, BASH,
          python and perl can be used for the script language or any
          interpretor that uses '#' as a comment marker.<br>
          A number of simple demo scripts are included in the folder
          "demotoools" ( good name eh ).<br>
          You can drag and drop a file onto the main toolbar/menu to
          open a file.<br>
          Session can be saved and reloaded.<br>
          Any amount of bookmarks can be added anywhere, selecting a
          bookmark from the menu will switch to that tab and move to the
          appropriate line.<br>
          Just type a line number into the edit box on the toolbar to
          jump straight to that line.</font><br>
