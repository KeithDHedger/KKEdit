This is a TEXT editor and although it can open some files that include binary data, it may not show the correct text, if you want a binary editor I would suggest you use somthing from here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_hex_editors
Or you can use vim, see the man page on your system.

See the INSTALL file for details about installing and dependencies.

Bugs and suggestions welcome please email to kdhedger68713@gmail.com
For general info on compiling/installing software on your disro see the relevant forums.
